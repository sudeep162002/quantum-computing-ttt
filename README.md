## Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe: Leveraging Quantum Computing for Game Simulations

**Author:** Sudeep Choudhary

This project delves into the intriguing intersection of quantum computing and game theory by simulating the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the IBM Qiskit framework and the quantum Hadamard gate.

### Abstract

Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple yet strategic game, serves as a fascinating introduction to the realm of quantum game theory. This project showcases the potential of quantum computing in game scenario simulations by implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe simulation utilizing:

* **Quantum Computing Framework:** This project employs the IBM Qiskit, a powerful open-source software platform that provides tools and libraries for building and running quantum circuits. Qiskit facilitates simulating quantum circuits on classical computers and allows for the potential execution on actual quantum hardware.
* **Quantum Hadamard Gate:** The Hadamard gate, a fundamental quantum operation, is employed in this project to represent the superposition of states for each cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This enables the exploration of multiple game possibilities simultaneously, harnessing the inherent power of quantum parallelism.

### Project Structure

The project relies on two key components:

* **`app.py`:** This script serves as the project's core, housing essential functions for:
    * Initializing the quantum circuit using Qiskit.
    * Implementing the game logic using classical control flow and quantum operations like the Hadamard gate.
    * Processing the game state and determining the winner.
* **`requirements.txt`:** This file lists the necessary Python packages required for running the project, including `qiskit` and `streamlit` (optional for building a web interface).

### Running the Project

1. **Create a new Python environment:** Use tools like `conda` or `venv` to create a new Python environment.
2. **Install required libraries:** Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Execute the script:** Run the project by executing the `app.py` script from the command line using `python app.py`.

### Real Quantum Hardware Potential

While this project utilizes Qiskit for simulation purposes, the designed circuit can be potentially executed on actual quantum hardware once such resources become readily available. This opens up exciting possibilities for exploring the intricacies of game theory and other computational problems within the realm of quantum computing.
