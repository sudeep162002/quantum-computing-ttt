## Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe: Leveraging Quantum Computing for Game Simulations**

**Author:** Sudeep Choudhary

This project explores the exciting intersection of quantum computing and game theory by simulating the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the IBM Qiskit framework and the quantum Hadamard gate.

**Abstract:**

Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple yet strategic game, serves as a compelling introduction to quantum game theory. This project demonstrates the potential of quantum computing for simulating game scenarios by implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe simulation using the following key components:

* **Quantum Computing Framework:** This project utilizes the IBM Qiskit, a powerful open-source software platform that provides tools and libraries for building and running quantum circuits. Qiskit facilitates the simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers and allows for the potential execution on actual quantum hardware.
* **Quantum Hadamard Gate:** The Hadamard gate, a fundamental quantum operation, is employed in this project to represent the superposition of states for each cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This enables the exploration of multiple game possibilities simultaneously, leveraging the inherent power of quantum parallelism.

**Project Structure:**

* **`app.py`:** This script serves as the core of the project, housing the essential functions for:
    * Initializing the quantum circuit using Qiskit.
    * Implementing the game logic using classical control flow and quantum operations like the Hadamard gate.
    * Processing the game state and determining the winner.
* **`requirements.txt`:** This file lists the necessary Python packages required for running the project, including `qiskit` and `streamlit` (optional for building a web interface).

**Running the Project:**

1. Create a new Python environment using tools like `conda` or `venv`.
2. Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the `app.py` script from the command line using `python app.py`.

**Real Quantum Hardware Potential:**

While this project utilizes Qiskit for simulation purposes, the designed circuit can be potentially executed on actual quantum hardware once such resources become readily available. This opens up possibilities for exploring the intricacies of game theory and other computational problems in the realm of quantum computing.
